I couldn't successfully get the provided UNIX calculation to work correctly so I sought if there was another formula - See below for the website used
  https://exceljet.net/formulas/convert-unix-time-stamp-to-excel-date
  
I also used the website below to double check if my approach to seeking the month and day was correct
  https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/3267-excel-split-date-into-day-month-year.html

I then used the following link to convert the numerical month to show the written month for the pivot table
